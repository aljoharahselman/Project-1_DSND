the Dataset i used is 

imdb dataset 

the questions i tried to answer: 

what was the top 4 movies based on rating?
what was the top 4 movies based on revenue?
what was the movie with the biggest budget?

Acknowledgement and credit:
dataset source: kaggle

Conclusions:
When I started the analysis i thought the best rated movies will be the same as the best revue but soon i realized they are not related because the best rated are not related to budget spent or revenue it was focused more on the art people enjoyed
